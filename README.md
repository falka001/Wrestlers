# Wrestlers
This C++ project creates two teams of wrestlers, and each team consists of 14 groups. 
The project allows the user to input the number of desired wrestlers for both teams, and then proceeds into creating random values for ability score and weight for each wrestler.
Afterwards, the wrestlers are assigned to each group depending on their weights. Then sorts the wrestlers based on there ability score in ascending order.
Finally, the wrestler with the highest ability score from each team compete against each other for each group, and the winning wrestler is determined by a random number generated.
Depending on the difference between the random generated number, the points are tracked until the last group match, and the total points are displayed at the end.

Note that this project is developed using pointers to advance the skills for structuring the code as one mistake with a pointer could have a great impact on results.
